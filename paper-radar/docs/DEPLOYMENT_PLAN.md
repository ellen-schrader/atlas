# Deployment plan

Getting the hosted stack (React web + FastAPI + Supabase) onto the internet.
This is the concrete follow-through on MIGRATION_PLAN.md §12 ("Environments &
deployment"). Status: **proposal — agree on this before building.**

## Where we are

The three tiers already exist, and one of them is already deployed:

| Tier | What | Today |
|---|---|---|
| Database + auth + storage | Supabase (Postgres, RLS, mood-board bucket) | **Already hosted** — managed project `eegjxioiidymmiizflkh.supabase.co`; both `api/.env` and `web/.env.local` point at it |
| API | FastAPI (`api.app:app`), Voyage embeddings over HTTP, `/health` endpoint | Runs locally via uvicorn only — no Dockerfile, no host |
| Web | Vite + React SPA (react-router), static build via `vite build` | Dev server only; talks to the API through `VITE_API_URL` (defaults to `127.0.0.1:8000`) |

So "deploying" means: containerize + host the API, build + host the SPA, and
wire the three tiers together with env vars. No data migration is needed.

## Recommended targets

- **Web → Vercel** (or Cloudflare Pages — either works; both are free-tier
  fine for a lab). Static output, SPA rewrite to `index.html`.
- **API → Fly.io** (or Railway/Render). A container host, per MIGRATION_PLAN
  §12. The API is light — it never touches sentence-transformers/torch,
  faiss, or numba (embeddings are Voyage API calls; the heavy deps are legacy
  Streamlit-era code, and the map layout is numba-free sklearn t-SNE) — so a
  small instance (512 MB–1 GB) should do.
- **DB stays on Supabase** as-is.

## Phases

### Phase 1 — environment & build prep (this branch)

1. ~~Copy `.env` files from the main worktree~~ ✓ (`paper-radar/.env`,
   `api/.env`, `web/.env.local` — all gitignored).
2. ✓ **Slim the Python install for the API image.** `pip install .[api]` today
   drags in sentence-transformers/torch and streamlit via the base
   dependencies (~2–3 GB image, slow cold builds). Move those two to a
   `legacy` extra in `pyproject.toml` (faiss-cpu too — `embed/index.py` now
   imports it lazily, so only the local-index CLI path needs it).
   scikit-learn stays in the base — the API's `/overview` map uses it for
   t-SNE + KMeans (`api/overview.py` → `paper_radar.embed.index`; UMAP and
   its numba chain were dropped entirely). The Streamlit app keeps working
   via `uv sync --extra dev --extra legacy`.
3. ✓ **Add `api/Dockerfile`** — `python:3.12-slim`, install with `uv` from the
   lockfile (`uv sync --frozen --extra api --no-dev`), run
   `uvicorn api.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080`. `/health` already exists
   for the host's health checks. Note: cryptography>=47 is pinned back to
   46.x on linux/aarch64 only (`[tool.uv] constraint-dependencies`, marker-
   scoped) — its aarch64 wheels SIGILL in the Docker Desktop VM; amd64 prod
   builds and dev machines stay current. Retest the pin on a version bump.
4. ✓ **Verify prod builds locally**: `docker build` (2 GB image, no torch) +
   container smoke test against hosted Supabase (`/health`; `/resolve` now needs a
   bearer token — an unauthenticated probe returns `401`, so hit it with a JWT or
   just smoke-test `/health`); `npm run build` in `web/` (tsc + vite) passes.

### Phase 2 — database hygiene (small, before first deploy)

5. ✓ Confirmed the hosted project is fully migrated:
   `supabase link --project-ref eegjxioiidymmiizflkh` + `supabase db push` →
   "Remote database is up to date"; `supabase migration list` shows all 16
   local migrations applied remotely.
6. ✓ **Backups (stopgap).** The org is on the **free plan** (no automated
   backups, no PITR), so `.github/workflows/db-backup.yml` dumps schema +
   data nightly (03:00 UTC) to private workflow artifacts, 30-day retention.
   Not covered: the mood-board storage bucket. Upgrade to Pro (daily
   backups + PITR option) once the lab depends on the data. The
   `service_role` key is server-side only (API env, never the web).

### Phase 3 — first manual deploy (done 2026-07-12)

7. ✓ **API on Fly.io**: app `paper-radar-api`, region lhr, 1× shared-cpu
   1 GB machine, auto-stop when idle (`fly.toml` in this directory). Live at
   **https://paper-radar-api.fly.dev**. Secrets set via `fly secrets import`:
   `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`,
   `VOYAGE_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `CORS_ORIGINS` (both web domains +
   localhost dev ports).
8. ✓ **Web on Vercel**: project `paper-radar` (linked from `web/`,
   `.vercel/project.json`), Vite preset, SPA fallback via `web/vercel.json`.
   Production domain **https://atlas-papers.vercel.app** (added as a project
   domain — `paper-radar.vercel.app` was taken by a stranger's project).
   Note: the default `paper-radar-ellen-schrader1.vercel.app` and per-deploy
   URLs sit behind Vercel SSO deployment protection; the added production
   domain is public. Build-time env on Vercel: `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`,
   `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `VITE_API_URL=https://paper-radar-api.fly.dev`.
9. ✓ **Supabase auth config**: Site URL → https://atlas-papers.vercel.app;
   allow-list covers both web domains + localhost (management API,
   `/config/auth`).
10. ✓ **Smoke test the real flows** (browser, 2026-07-12): sign up, post a
    paper by URL, comment, semantic search, mood board upload, map view all
    work in production. Untested: @mention notify (needs a second lab
    member — retest when one joins, or sign up a second account into the
    same lab).

### Phase 4 — CI/CD

11. ✓ `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`: on push to `main` (paths-filtered to
    `paper-radar/**`), `supabase link` + `db push`, then `fly deploy
    --remote-only` — migrations land before the API, per MIGRATION_PLAN §12.
    If `db push` needs the database password in headless CI, add a
    `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD` repo secret and pass it to the link step.
12. ✓ **Repo secrets**: `FLY_API_TOKEN` and `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` are set.
    If the first CI `db push` fails to authenticate headless, also set
    `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD` — the workflow already passes it through when
    present.
13. ✓ **Web via Vercel git integration**: GitHub App installed and the repo
    connected (production branch `main`, `rootDirectory` `paper-radar/web`,
    preview + production env vars set) — PR previews and production web
    deploys are automatic. Manual CLI deploys still work:
    `vercel deploy --prod` from `paper-radar/web` (the CLI ignores
    `rootDirectory` for uploads from that directory).

### Known issue — Fly trial plan (needs a card)

The Fly account is on the trial plan: **machines are force-stopped after 5
minutes** ("Trial machine stopping. To run for longer than 5m0s, add a credit
card" in the logs). Until a card is added at fly.io, the in-process layout
cache never survives, and users hitting the ~35 s cold boot window see 502s
(which Fly Doctor misreports as "app not listening on the expected port").
The map itself works within each window since the layout moved from UMAP to
numba-free t-SNE (`compute_layout_2d`) — UMAP's per-process JIT compile took
longer on the shared vCPU than the trial let the machine live. The 5-minute
kill and boot-window 502s only go away with a card.

### Phase 5 — later / as needed

- Custom domain + TLS on both hosts (defaults `*.vercel.app` / `*.fly.dev`
  work day one).
- Uptime check against `/health`; Fly log drain or just `fly logs` initially.
- Background enrichment worker (summary/tags via Claude) — currently
  in-process `BackgroundTasks`; fine at lab scale, revisit if posts spike.
- The stdio MCP server (`atlas_mcp`) stays local — it's a desktop-side tool,
  nothing to deploy.

## Env var wiring (prod)

```
web (build-time)                api (runtime secrets)
  VITE_SUPABASE_URL      ──┐      SUPABASE_URL            ──┐
  VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY ──┼──►   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY       ──┼──► Supabase (hosted)
  VITE_API_URL ──► api           SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY ─┘
                                 VOYAGE_API_KEY  ──► Voyage
                                 ANTHROPIC_API_KEY ──► Claude (enrichment)
                                 CORS_ORIGINS = web origin
```

## Open decisions

1. **Hosts** — decided: Vercel for the web. Fly.io for the API (the API can't
   go on Vercel serverless — `POST /posts` embeds in-process via
   `BackgroundTasks` after the response, which serverless kills).
2. **Custom domain now or later?** Later is fine; changing it only touches
   `CORS_ORIGINS`, `VITE_API_URL`, and Supabase auth URLs.
3. **Dep split (phase 1, step 2)** — touching `pyproject.toml` affects the
   Streamlit legacy app's install command. Cheap now, annoying later; I'd do
   it in this branch.
